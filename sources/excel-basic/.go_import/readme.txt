The Excel Basic source should be used when we have a customer that has some unstructured data they want to import to LIME Go.

When the ask "do you have an excel tempate we can use?" we should create a project from this source and send them the 'Exempelfil.xslx'. When we get the excelfile back, copy it to the project folder and run 'go-import run'.
